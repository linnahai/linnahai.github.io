<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome! I'm currently a third-year Mphill student in Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. My primary research interests are in medicinal chemistry, Biomedicine and AIDD.

I obtained my Bachelor in Pharmacy from Jinan University. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research member of .

Currently, I'm looking for a Ph.D. position in biomedicine and AIDD.

[Manganese-Enriched Zinc Peroxide Functional Nanoparticles for Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c02941)

Meng Li, Zhou Shuang, LiangDan Liu et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* The study presents manganese-enriched zinc peroxide nanoparticles (MONPs), which disassemble in the acidic TME to generate hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH), inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. This process helps trigger an immune response against the tumor.
* MONPs also activate the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway, leading to the secretion of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. This activates T cell responses, further enhancing the body's anti-tumor immunity.
* MONPs alleviate the immunosuppressive TME by reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reprogramming M2 macrophages to the M1 phenotype. This promotes a more robust adaptive immune response, especially when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, improving tumor growth inhibition and preventing metastasis.

[A bi-adjuvant nanovaccine amplifying STING activation for cancer immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2024.102372)

Dan Liu, Shuang Liang, Kongshuo Ma et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* The researchers created a nanovaccine combining a STING agonist (MnO‚ÇÇ nanoparticles), CpG (TLR9 agonist), and tumor antigens to enhance immune activation and tumor targeting.
* The nanovaccine effectively activated the STING signaling pathway, increased type-I interferon responses, and promoted CD8+ T cell activation and humoral immunity, leading to strong tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival in melanoma and HPV-derived tumor models.
* The nanovaccine synergized with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, showing 80% survival in the TC-1 tumor model, and induced long-term immune memory, preventing tumor growth upon rechallenge.

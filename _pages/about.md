Welcome! I'm currently a third-year Mphill student in Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. My primary research interests are in medicinal chemistry, Biomedicine and AIDD.

I obtained my Bachelor in Pharmacy from Jinan University. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research member of .

Currently, I'm looking for a Ph.D. position in biomedicine and AIDD.

[Manganese-Enriched Zinc Peroxide Functional Nanoparticles for Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c02941)

Meng Li, Zhou Shuang, LiangDan Liu et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* We developed manganese-enriched zinc peroxide nanoparticles (MONPs) that disassemble in the acidic TME to generate hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH), inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activating anti-tumor immunity.
* Our MONPs also activate the STING pathway, triggering type I interferon secretion and boosting T cell responses.
* MONPs reduce regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reprogram M2 macrophages to M1, enhancing adaptive immunity and improving tumor inhibition, especially when combined with anti-PD-1 therapy.

[A bi-adjuvant nanovaccine amplifying STING activation for cancer immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2024.102372)

Dan Liu, Shuang Liang, Kongshuo Ma et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* We developed a bi-adjuvant nanovaccine (MnC NVs) that combines STING agonist (MnO2), TLR9 agonist (CpG), and antigenic peptides to enhance anti-tumor immunity.
* The nanovaccine effectively activated dendritic cells, triggered type-I interferon signaling, and induced strong CD8+ T cell responses, leading to significant tumor inhibition and improved survival.
* MnC NVs demonstrated synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and induced long-term memory, showing potential for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

Yuxuan Peng, Shuang Liang, Dan Liu et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* Mn-LDH was synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method, combining proton neutralization and oxygen production abilities.
* Mn-LDH releases Mn¬≤‚Å∫ and Mg¬≤‚Å∫ in the TME, activating the STING pathway and boosting CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.
* Local administration of Mn-LDH created a pro-inflammatory immune network, significantly inhibiting both primary and distal tumors, with enhanced effects from its photothermal properties.

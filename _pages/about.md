Welcome! I'm currently a third-year Mphill student in Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. My primary research interests are in medicinal chemistry, Biomedicine and AIDD.

I obtained my Bachelor in Pharmacy from Jinan University. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research member of .

Currently, I'm looking for a Ph.D. position in biomedicine and AIDD.

[Manganese-Enriched Zinc Peroxide Functional Nanoparticles for Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c02941)

Meng Li, Zhou Shuang, LiangDan Liu et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* We developed manganese-enriched zinc peroxide nanoparticles (MONPs) that disassemble in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH), which induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. This process helps activate an immune response against the tumor.
* Our MONPs also activate the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway, leading to the secretion of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, stimulates T cell responses, further enhancing the body's anti-tumor immunity.
* We found that MONPs alleviate the immunosuppressive effects of the TME by reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reprogramming M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype. This boosts a stronger adaptive immune response, especially when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, leading to better tumor growth inhibition and prevention of metastasis.

[A bi-adjuvant nanovaccine amplifying STING activation for cancer immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2024.102372)

Dan Liu, Shuang Liang, Kongshuo Ma et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* We developed manganese-enriched zinc peroxide nanoparticles (MONPs) that disassemble in the acidic TME to generate hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH), which trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. This process helps activate the immune system to target the tumor.
* Our MONPs also activate the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway, leading to the secretion of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. This in turn stimulates T cell responses, further boosting anti-tumor immunity.
* By reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reprogramming M2 macrophages to the M1 phenotype, MONPs help alleviate the immunosuppressive effects of the TME. This promotes a stronger adaptive immune response, especially when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, significantly improving tumor growth inhibition and preventing metastasis.

[Multi-Metallic Nanosheets Reshaping Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment through Augmenting cGAS-STING Innate Activation and Adaptive Immune Responses for Cancer Immunotherapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/advs.202403347)

Yuxuan Peng, Shuang Liang, Dan Liu et al., **Linna Hai** et al., Zhaohui Wang

* We synthesized Mn-LDH using a one-step hydrothermal method. In addition to its proton neutralization ability, the inclusion of manganese oxide grants Mn-LDH the capability to produce oxygen, which is crucial for modulating the TME.

* Upon exposure to the TME, Mn-LDH releases Mn¬≤‚Å∫ and Mg¬≤‚Å∫ ions, which activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and enhance the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. This cascade effect boosts both innate and adaptive immune responses.

* Local administration of Mn-LDH created a "hot" immune network, including mature dendritic cells, M1 macrophages, and activated T cells, which significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distal tumors. Furthermore, its photothermal conversion ability enhanced therapeutic outcomes in larger tumor models following a single treatment and irradiation.
